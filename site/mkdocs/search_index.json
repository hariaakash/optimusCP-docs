Each box contains a group of API's which can be used for a particular project which you are working on hence to make it easy to manage project oriented API's.\nEach box is identified with their own identification name that is Box ID and it is unique to every box created for each user.\nHence each box can be identified like the one below:\n\n\nhttps://proapi.co/api/[uname]/[bid]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuname\n : username of your account which you have chosen when creating\n\n\n\n\nbid\n : Box ID which is unique to every box created to a particular account\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPI's\n\n\nEach Box can have API's created and similarily each API can be identified by their unique API ID.

Hence when sending request it should be of the following format.\n\n\nPOST Request : https://proapi.co/api/[uname]/[bid]/[aid]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeader\n : Header of POST Request should contain apiKey which is unique to each API.\n\n\n\n\napikey: 'APIKEY'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBody\n : The data which you wish to be send through our gateway inside data.\n\n\n\n\ndata1: 'data1',\ndata2: 'data2'\n\n\n\n\nWhitelisting\n\n\nIn cases where you want to whitelist the domain from which the API's are being send, then you can use the one below.\n\n\nproapi.co",
